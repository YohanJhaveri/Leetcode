# Problem 101: Symmetric Tree

[https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

## Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, *check whether it is a mirror of itself* (i.e., symmetric around its center).

## Examples

Example 1:

![example1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

Example 2:

![example2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
