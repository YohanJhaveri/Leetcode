# Problem 234: Palindrome Linked List

[https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)

## Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return `true` *if it is a palindrome or* `false` **otherwise**.

## Examples

Example 1:

![example1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/03/pal1linked-list.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
```

Example 2:

![example2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/03/pal2linked-list.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 105]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
